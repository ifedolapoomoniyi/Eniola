# Eniola Agunbiade's Resume Website

This is a resume website that was built for a friend. It was built with React and styled with CSS. It is a single page website that contains the following sections:

- `Home` - which has a pretty picture of her and a short bio.

- `Bio`

- `Resume` - which has a dropdown for different skills under her resume as she is stock full of talent.

- `Footer` - which has links to her social media handles.
